The planar diagram notation for an oriented knot may be obtained from a diagram
as follows. First label its edges from $1$ to $n$, where $n$ is the number of
edges. Choose a first component and a starting edge, labeled by $1$. Label
subsequent edges of the component in order according to its orientation.
